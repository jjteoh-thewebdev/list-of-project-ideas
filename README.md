# List of Project Ideas
A curated list of project ideas to build. (For learning/portfolio/fun)

Most of the ideas here are *recreating the wheel*-type of projects. 
Because I strongly believe it is a powerful way to learn and understand how great things are built.

Here are the benefits of doing it:
1. **Real-world problems**: These apps solve complex, real-world challenges. Rebuilding them forces you to think deeply about architecture, performance, scalability, and UX.
2. **Pattern recognition**: You start noticing the design patterns and conventions used by top engineers and designers. These patterns often become second nature.
3. **Tech stack mastery**: Whether it's React, NestJS, Docker, or GraphQL, working on these replicas gave me a safe, yet practical, space to sharpen my skills. 
5. **Craftsmanship appreciation**: You begin to appreciate how every tiny feature—like search autocomplete or drag-and-drop—takes deliberate thought and design.
6. **Building experience**: These apps didn’t become popular overnight. They went through countless iterations—refining usability, fixing edge cases, and learning from failures. By studying and rebuilding them, we inherit the hard-earned lessons behind their success.
As a wise man once said: *“I want to have your experience without going through what you have experienced—especially the bad ones!”*

The objective is to understand what problems to solve, learn the key concepts, technologies, design patterns and etc. Learning > building perfect clone.
